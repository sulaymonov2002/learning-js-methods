 <------ String methods ------>

We have worked with strings already and chances are that you have run into some of the methods on strings by now. 
There are a few we didn't address specifically just yet and we are going to discuss them in this section. ✅ 

🎁 1. <------ Combining strings ------>

When you want to concatenate strings, you can use the concat() method. 
This does not change the original string(s); it returns the combined result as a string. ✅ 

🎁 2.  <------ Converting an array to a string ------>

With the join() method you can convert an array to a string. Here is a basic example:

let letters = ["a", "b", "c"];
let x = letters.join();
console.log(x); ✅ 


The type of x is string. 
If you want something else other than a comma, you can specify that, like this:
let letters = ["a", "b", "c"];
let x = letters.join('-');
console.log(x); ✅ 


🎁 3. <------ Working with index and positions ------>

 let notFound = searchStr.search("JavaScript");
console.log(notFound); ✅ 

search() will accept a regex format as input, whereas indexOf() just takes a string.
indexOf() is faster than the search() method, 
so if you just need to look for a string, use indexOf().
 If you need to look for a string pattern, you'll have to use the search() method.

 🎁 4. <------ Creating substrings ------>

 With the slice(start, end) method we can create substrings.
 This does not alter the original string, but returns a new string with the substring.
 It takes two parameters, the first is the index at which it starts and the second is the end index. 
 If you leave out the second index it will just continue until the end of the string from the start.

 🎁 5. <------ Replacing parts of the string ------>

 If you need to replace a part of the string, you can use the replace(old, new) method.
 It takes two arguments, one string to look for in the string and one new value to replace the old value with.
